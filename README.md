# Pomodoro Timer made using Tkinter.
An application based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Which as follows:


* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
* Work on the task.
* End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).[4]
* Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
* After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.


This application follows the standard of 25 work session, 5 minute break session, followed by a 20 minute long break session after 4 repetitions have been completed.

If the timer has finished, it will bring itself to the front of your desktop to show you that it is break/work time.

Clicking [START] will start the timer (obviously) and [RESET] to reset the timer and the amount of repetitions you've completed.
